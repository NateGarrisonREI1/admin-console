# REI Strategic Positioning (v4)
## The Home Upgrade Operating System — Powered by LEAF

**Status:** Active — Updated February 18, 2026
**Model:** B2B SaaS Platform + In-House Service Operations
**Core Product:** LEAF Report (the engine that drives everything)

---

## What REI Is

REI is the operating system that connects everyone involved in home upgrades — brokers, contractors, HES assessors, home inspectors, and homeowners — through one platform, powered by the LEAF energy report.

**The LEAF report is the backbone.** Homeowners simulate their home's energy profile. That simulation generates actionable data — which systems need upgrading, what it'll cost, what they'll save. That data becomes leads. Those leads become revenue for everyone on the platform.

Everyone who touches a transaction makes money. Everyone wins.

## How It Works

```
HOMEOWNER JOURNEY:
                                                    
Homeowner buys home → Broker sends LEAF link
        ↓
Homeowner runs LEAF simulation (free)
        ↓
LEAF shows: "Your HVAC is 18 years old. Replacing it saves $1,200/yr."
        ↓
Homeowner clicks "Get Estimate" on HVAC
        ↓
Lead auto-created → posted to broker's network + open market
        ↓
HVAC contractor purchases lead ($50-$150)
        ↓
Contractor gets homeowner contact + LEAF executive summary
        ↓
Contractor closes the job
        ↓
Everyone gets paid:
  → Contractor: job revenue ($8,000 HVAC install)
  → Broker: 70% of lead price ($52.50 on a $75 lead)
  → REI: 30% of lead price ($22.50)
  → Homeowner: lower energy bills + better home
```

## Revenue Model

### Primary Revenue: Lead Marketplace (30% Platform Fee)

Every lead sold on the platform, REI takes 30%.

| Trade | Lead Price Range | REI Take (30%) | Poster Take (70% - 2% fee) |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| HVAC (Heating & Cooling) | $50–$150 | $15–$45 | $34.30–$102.90 |
| Water Heater | $20–$75 | $6–$22.50 | $13.72–$51.45 |
| Solar | $75–$200 | $22.50–$60 | $51.45–$137.20 |
| Electrical | $20–$60 | $6–$18 | $13.72–$41.16 |
| Plumbing | $20–$60 | $6–$18 | $13.72–$41.16 |

**Pricing Rules:**
- Lead prices set by whoever posts (broker or REI admin)
- Must stay within admin-configured min/max per trade
- Prevents price gouging
- Admin can adjust ranges anytime (affects new leads only)
- Exclusive leads — one contractor per lead, no bidding wars

**Revenue Split Mechanics:**
- Contractor pays lead price via Stripe
- REI holds funds
- 30% retained by REI
- 70% allocated to poster (broker or REI)
- 2% service fee deducted from poster's share
- Poster net: 68.6% of lead price
- Payouts to brokers on schedule (monthly/quarterly)

### Secondary Revenue: In-House Service Delivery

REI also delivers HES assessments and home inspections directly.

| Service | Price Range | Margin |
|---------|------------|--------|
| HES Assessment (Small) | $125 | ~50% |
| HES Assessment (Mid) | $150 | ~50% |
| HES Assessment (Large) | $175 | ~50% |
| Home Inspection (Small) | $400 | ~50% |
| Home Inspection (Mid) | $600 | ~50% |
| Home Inspection (Large) | $800 | ~50% |
| Inspection Add-Ons | $150–$500 ea | ~40% |

Service pricing managed through Service Catalog (admin console).

## Platform Economics (Target)

### Per Broker (Monthly)
- Active broker posts ~50 leads/month
- Average lead price: $75
- Broker gross: $75 × 50 × 68.6% = $2,572.50/month
- REI gross: $75 × 50 × 30% = $1,125/month per broker

### At Scale
- 25 active brokers: $28,125/month from broker lead commissions
- + In-house services: ~$7,500/month
- + Direct lead revenue: ~$5,000/month
- **Target: $40,000+ MRR at 25 brokers**

### At National Scale (100+ brokers)
- 100 brokers × $1,125/month = $112,500/month
- + services + direct = $150,000+/month
- **$1.5M+ ARR achievable with 100 active brokers**

## The Two Businesses

REI operates two complementary models through one admin console:

### Business 1: Broker SaaS Platform (Scalable, High Margin)
- REI provides the infrastructure
- Brokers run their own networks
- Revenue: 30% of every lead sold through broker networks
- Margin: 80%+ (pure software)
- Scales: unlimited brokers, no additional headcount needed

### Business 2: In-House Service Operations (Defensive, Geographic Fill)
- REI employs HES assessors + home inspectors
- Serves areas where broker coverage is thin
- Revenue: service fees (HES, inspections, add-ons)
- Margin: 40-50% (staff + overhead)
- Scales: with hiring (linear, not exponential)

**Why both matter:**
- SaaS scales revenue nationally
- In-house builds credibility and fills geographic gaps
- In-house generates outcome data that makes LEAF smarter
- Combined: diversified revenue + defensible moat

## The LEAF Report — Platform Backbone

LEAF is not a feature. It's the engine that powers the entire platform.

**LEAF creates value at every stage:**

1. **For Homeowners:** Free energy simulation → understand their home → know what to upgrade
2. **For Brokers:** Differentiating tool at closing → "I have this service none of my competitors offer"
3. **For the Marketplace:** Every simulation generates up to THREE types of leads:
   - System service leads (HVAC, Solar, etc.) → sold to contractors
   - HES assessment leads (homeowner wants DOE-compliant score) → fulfilled by REI or affiliate
   - Home inspection leads (homeowner wants full property clarity) → fulfilled by REI or affiliate
4. **For Contractors:** LEAF executive summary = know exactly what the homeowner needs before first contact
5. **For REI:** One LEAF simulation can generate 3-4 revenue events. LEAF isn't just top of funnel — it IS the funnel.

**Why LEAF creates HES + Inspection leads:**
- A free LEAF simulation is based on homeowner-inputted data (not measured)
- This means it's NOT DOE-compliant — it's an estimate
- Inside the LEAF report, the homeowner sees:
  - "Want this report to be DOE-compliant? Request a Home Energy Score" → creates HES lead
  - "Want full property clarity? Request a Home Inspection" → creates inspection lead
  - Future: "Want the comprehensive LEAF? Get the full in-home assessment for $199" → creates paid LEAF lead
- The broker who sent the LEAF link earns commission on the system leads AND the assessments/inspections flow through REI's service catalog
- One campaign, four revenue streams

**Campaign Math (1,000 LEAF links sent):**
- ~200 homeowners complete simulation (20% completion rate)
- ~150 system leads generated (75% of completions click "Get Estimate")
- ~80 HES requests (40% want DOE compliance)
- ~40 inspection requests (20% want full clarity)
- System lead revenue: 150 × $75 avg = $11,250 (poster keeps ~$7,700, REI keeps ~$3,375)
- HES revenue: 80 × $150 avg = $12,000 (service catalog pricing)
- Inspection revenue: 40 × $600 avg = $24,000 (service catalog pricing)
- **Total from one campaign: ~$47,250 in platform activity**
- Broker's cut of system leads alone: ~$7,700/month from one campaign

**Free LEAF (MVP):**
- Self-serve simulation
- Homeowner inputs home data
- Gets recommendations + cost estimates
- CTA: "Get Estimate" → creates lead
- 3 system types: HVAC, Water Heater, Solar

**Paid LEAF (Future — $199):**
- Professional in-home assessment
- Tech measures and inputs real data
- Full comprehensive report (all systems, all trades)
- Much more accurate than self-serve
- Generates 5-15x more leads per home
- Unlocks: Electrical, Plumbing, Insulation, Windows, Roofing, Landscaping, Painting, etc.

## Contractor Network Strategy (The Trojan Horse)

Contractors are the key to platform liquidity. No contractors = no one buying leads = brokers don't make money = brokers leave.

**Strategy: Get contractors on first.**

Why contractors join even before brokers:
1. **Free business tools** — organize customers, manage network, track jobs
2. **Free referral system** — send work to buddies, get work from buddies
3. **Access to leads** — even small volume is valuable to independent contractors
4. **No monthly fee** — only pay when they buy a lead they want
5. **Build reputation** — ratings and close rate visible to brokers

**The flywheel:**
```
Contractors join (free tools) →
Contractors want leads →
REI recruits brokers ("we have contractors ready to buy your leads") →
Brokers join + post leads →
Contractors buy leads →
Brokers make money →
Brokers post more leads →
More contractors join →
Network effects kick in →
Everyone's making money →
Nobody leaves
```

**Contractor-to-Contractor Network (Unique Value Prop):**
- Contractors build a personal rolodex of other contractors on the platform
- "My HVAC guy finishes a job, homeowner mentions they need plumbing work"
- HVAC guy sends referral to his plumber buddy through the platform
- Plumber gets the customer info + job description via email/text
- No fee between contractors (MVP) — pure value add
- Keeps contractors sticky and brings in new contractors through word-of-mouth
- Future: optional referral fee between contractors

---

## Broker Network Framework (Future-Proof)

Brokers build networks of service providers. MVP supports 5 trades, but the framework supports unlimited:

**MVP Active Trades:**
- HVAC (Heating & Cooling)
- Water Heater
- Solar

**MVP Framework Ready (leads coming with paid LEAF):**
- Electrical
- Plumbing
- General Handyman
- Insulation
- Windows & Doors
- Roofing
- Landscaping
- Painting
- Foundation/Structural
- And more...

**How brokers add network members:**
- Broker console → Network page → Add Member
- Select trade type
- Enter contractor info (or invite via email)
- Contractor gets invite → creates account → joins broker's network
- OR: contractor on open market does good work for broker's client → broker invites to network

**The vision:** Every broker has a full-service network. Any homeowner need, any trade — the broker has someone. Broker becomes the one-stop shop for home services. All powered by REI infrastructure.

## Admin Console Purpose

### Broker Platform Oversight (Broker Dashboard)
- Monitor broker activity, health scores, revenue
- Lead marketplace health (conversion rates, abandoned leads)
- Contractor performance across all networks
- Revenue tracking + broker payouts
- Lead pricing config (set min/max ranges per trade)

### In-House Operations (Main Dashboard)
- REI team management (HES + Inspectors)

- Direct lead management
- Service catalog + pricing
- In-house revenue tracking

### System Administration
- User management (all roles, relationships, sources)
- Auth logs + security
- Platform-wide settings
- Lead pricing guardrails

---

## Competitive Positioning

**REI is NOT competing with:**
- HomeAdvisor/Angi (they sell leads to contractors at massive scale, low quality, non-exclusive)
- Thumbtack (similar — lead marketplace, but commodity leads)
- Energy audit companies (they do the work, they don't platform it)

**REI IS competing on:**
- **Quality over quantity:** Exclusive leads with real LEAF data attached
- **Broker-controlled networks:** Contractors aren't random — they're vetted by the broker
- **Data advantage:** LEAF reports mean contractors know exactly what the homeowner needs
- **Revenue alignment:** Everyone makes money (broker, contractor, REI) — not just the platform
- **White-label trust:** Homeowner trusts their broker, not a faceless marketplace
- **Network effects:** More brokers → more leads → more contractors → better service → more brokers

## The Vision

**Year 1:** Portland proof of concept — 25 brokers, 50 contractors, $40K MRR
**Year 2:** Oregon + expansion states — 200 brokers, 500 contractors, $500K MRR
**Year 3:** National platform — 1,000+ brokers, 5,000+ contractors, $3M+ MRR

The LEAF report gets smarter with every home assessed. The marketplace gets more liquid with every contractor added. The network effects compound. The data moat deepens.

REI becomes the infrastructure layer for home upgrades in America — not by owning the transactions, but by powering the network that makes them happen.

## One-Liner

**"REI powers the network that turns home energy data into revenue for brokers, contractors, and homeowners — through one platform, driven by the LEAF report."**
